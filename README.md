# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The purpose of the project was to write all the tests needed to make sure the web-app runs smoothly


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## How to setup project?
To test the jasmine library, before you use a texteditor, make sure jasmine is installed on your local server

For detailed instructions to install Jasmine(via Node):
https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine

After installing jasmine on the server, make sure you have ATOM or any text editor installed
Open, the index.html file along with the css and js files onto your text texteditor
After opening the index.html file, run the code to check whether jasmine tests have passed/failed
